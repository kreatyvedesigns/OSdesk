# Heading level 1 OSdesk


OSdesk is an Posix / Linux environment for OSI / ISO layers.
The idea came from how to customize a Debian iso to run my networking methods.

So the idea began, I decided to wirte it and give it to the open source community.
There are several layers inside it, it can be considered more for Linux other as equal for Apple.

Linux Layers / Apple:
* Magic Eyes relied on node and angularjs from <http://angular.io>
* core Desktop environment based on openbox
* Apps compatible with Linux and posix systems
* scripts and boot files for Linux/mac
* Templates in vala, python, c, gtk-3.0
 
These whole system is a workaround for OSI but in less size.
